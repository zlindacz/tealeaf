Dear NOUN, we need to VERB. You know you are the most ADJECTIVE NOUN I know, and I VERB you very much. I could not VERB without you, and that is where I found the NOUN to VERB you today. Every time we VERB, you seem so ADJECTIVE, and I feel that it is time we put a NOUN to it. Let's not VERB anymore; let's instead VERB. I VERB you so much, and if we both VERB, we will have ADJECTIVE and ADJECTIVE NOUN together. Let's VERB!
